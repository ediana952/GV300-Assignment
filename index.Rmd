Hi, I’m Ediana Alla.

I am an Economics and Politics student studying in the UK. Outside uni you’ll usually find me playing basketball, planning my next trip, or working on a new language. I’m also learning R and Python. 

This site is a place to collect projects I’m proud of and keep them easy to share starting with my [GV300 Showcase](gv300.html).
